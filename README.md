# Strawberry Ripeness Detection Using YOLO 🍓🔍
Strawberry detection using YOLO . It detects the strawberry is ripe or unripe.

This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify strawberries in images and classify them as ripe or unripe. The model is trained on a dataset of strawberries at different ripeness stages to assist in automated fruit sorting and precision agriculture.

🔹 Features:
✔ Detects strawberries in real-time
✔ Classifies them as ripe or unripe
✔ Trained using YOLO for fast and efficient detection
✔ Helps optimize harvesting and quality control

🔹 Technologies Used:
YOLOv8 (based on implementation)
Python, OpenCV, PyTorch
Custom-labeled dataset for ripeness classification
This project contributes to smart farming by enabling automated ripeness detection, reducing manual labor, and improving crop quality. 🌱🚜
